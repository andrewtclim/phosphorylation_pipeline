To run the pipeline (from repo root):

First try:
python scripts/run_pipeline.py

If that fails with "No module named phospho", run:
python -m scripts.run_pipeline
This runs it as a module so Python can resolve package imports from the repo root.

If VERSA_API_KEY is not recognized, load .env into your shell first:
set -a
source .env
set +a

This does:
- set -a: auto-export variables
- source .env: load env vars from file
- set +a: turn auto-export back off

Then run again:
python -m scripts.run_pipeline
